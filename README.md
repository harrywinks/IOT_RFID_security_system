### ■&nbsp;&nbsp;Project Introduction
The goal of this project is to improve physical security of enterprise with RFID systems and ensure that assets can be managed safely and efficiently. It has the following advantages:

#### **1. The research strengthens the management of equipment and personnel in various companies**
- This can make the use of the equipment and people become clearer so that the management becomes more convenient. 
- It also reduces the possibility of theft and loss. 
- Even if theft and loss occur, liability can be found from the person who used the equipment.

#### **2. The technology of security level based on RFID will classify the safety level according to the characteristics of different equipment.**
- Using the classification of security level, it will become more convenient to manage equipment.
- In addition, it can have a more precise concept for future buying of equipment.

#### **3. Based on the function of collecting information through RFID, epidemiological investigation can be carried out.**
- Through the time information stored when people pass the system, tracing the movement becomes effective.
